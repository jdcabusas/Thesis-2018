# Thesis-2018
Compilation of files used for Garbage Bin Integration Thesis

I graduated April 2018 and all files for this project were uploaded to Github about a year later. Sadly I do not remember much of the context and deployment of the files but this as a web application I designed and deployed to be able to track the status of garbage bins that were distibuted throughout our university campus.

The main reason for this upload was to have a repository for the files for a project that I do not remember much of however very proud of.
